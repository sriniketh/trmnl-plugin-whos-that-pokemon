# What is it?
This repo fetches data for a Pokémon at random every day at 12:00 UTC and saves it to the repo so that it can be polled from a private plugin on TRMNL.

## Manual install

You can choose to fork the plugin from recipes OR do the following:

### Step 1: Configure private plugin
1. Create a [private plugin](https://usetrmnl.com/plugin_settings?keyname=private_plugin) from the TRMNL dashboard
2. Set the strategy to `Polling`
3. Set the polling URL to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sriniketh/trmnl-plugin-whos-that-pokemon/refs/heads/main/pokemon_data/response.json
4. Set the polling headers as `content-type=application/json`

Refer [settings.yml](https://github.com/sriniketh/trmnl-plugin-whos-that-pokemon/blob/main/settings.yml) for more info.

### Step 2: Setup templates
Copy the full, half horizontal, half vertical and quadrant views from the `views/` directory and paste it as markup for the plugin on the dashboard.

The Github Action workflow [Fetch and save random Pokemon](https://github.com/sriniketh/trmnl-plugin-whos-that-pokemon/actions/workflows/fetch_and_save_pokemon.yml) will trigger once a day and save the response in `/pokemon_data`.
